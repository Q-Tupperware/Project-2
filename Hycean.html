    <p class="desc">K2-18 is a Super Earth 8.92 times Earth's mass which orbits it's star every 32.9 days which is believed to be covered in oceans
    of liquid water. This fact, along with it being in the habitable zone and the detection of methane and carbon dioxide in it's hydrogen-rich atmosphere,
