    <h2>What is an Exoplanet?</h2>

    <p>An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet found outside of Earth's solar system. Some of them are found in orbit of other stars, but not all!
Many, during the formative years of their home solar system, are launched into an unstable orbit by their fellow celestial bodies, becoming rogue planets. 
Solar system formation is so violent, in fact, that it is curretnly believed that there are 20 times as many rogue planets then there are stars in the milky way!
Even with rogue planets aside, the category of exoplanets is a very broad group of celestial bodies which features a wide variety of oddities, such as HD 189733 b, where rain is made of glass aned falls sideways.</p>

    <h2>How do we Find Exoplanets, and Why?</h2>
    <p>There are three primary methods for finding star-bound exoplanets: radial velocity, which detects how a planet's pull on it's star wobbles it and changes the spectrum of light we recieve from it which is the most successful but can't detect Earth-sized planets,
        astrometry, which measures a star's wobble by directly recording it's position and is effective with nearby low-mass stars but is only effective with out-of-atmosphere telescopes and is also unable to detect small planets,
        and transit, which detects change in the light level of a star as one of it's planets passes between it and us.
        We go through the bother of al these methods and more to for many reasons. Studying exoplanets tell us more about how the physical and chemical makeups of solar systems form, and from that better understand how our solar system formed to make us.
        As well, as you might expect, we look to exoplanets in hopes of finding extraterrestrial life, with some good candidates such as Hycean worlds like K2-18 b, which are Super Earths and Sub-neptunes believed to be hot and covered in oceans of water and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.
