    <p class="desc"> HD 189733 b is a blue gas giant 1.13 times the size of Jupiter wihich orbits its star every 2.2 days due to orbiting
         very close to it. This proximity to its star causes HD 189733's daytime temperatures 
         to reach temperatures in the range of 2,000 degrees farenheit, which is believed to cause the creation 4,500 mph winds 
         and glass from the silicates which give the planet's atmosphere its blue hue. This glass forms and is pulled apart
         into droplets by the wind, thus the creating the glass rain this planet is imfamous for.</p>
